# rect-editor

Drag and drop rectangle editor

## TODO

- If a rect selected, `Delete` key removes
- If a selected rect is dragged, it moves
- Selected rect should have resize handles, drag to resize
- If handle is dragged with `Shift` key (?) down, rect maintains aspect ratio
- Selected rect should have a form to edit eg x, y, width, height
- If tap in draw mode, location is x,y - modal asks for width and height
- Way to change z-index of rects (bring forward, send to back etc)
